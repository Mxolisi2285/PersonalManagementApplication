# PersonalManagementApplication

PersonalManagementApplication is a full-stack web application designed to help users manage their personal notes efficiently and securely. Users can sign up, log in, and create, edit, or delete notes in a user-friendly environment. The backend is built with Spring Boot, providing robust business logic and seamless integration with the H2 in-memory database for storing user data and notes. Authentication is handled securely through email/password login as well as optional Google OAuth2 login, while email notifications via SMTP support features like password reset. The frontend uses Thymeleaf templates enhanced with TinyMCE for rich-text note creation, enabling formatting, links, images, and lists, and all forms are protected with CSRF tokens. The H2 console is enabled for development purposes, allowing easy database inspection. Installation is straightforward: clone the repository, configure the `application.properties` file with your email and OAuth2 credentials, and run the Spring Boot application. Features include creating, editing, deleting, and viewing notes, secure authentication, responsive design for desktop and mobile, and email notifications for account actions. To use the application, start the server on port 8080, access the login or signup page, and begin managing notes immediately. This application provides a lightweight, secure, and maintainable solution for personal note management, and its modular architecture allows developers to extend functionality easily with features like tagging, search, or cloud storage integration, making it a practical tool for both end-users and developers alike.
